            JavaScript also allows your page to be interactive in other ways that do not involve forms at all. You can add animations into the page which either attract attention to a specific part of the page or which make the page easier to use.You can provide responses within the web page to various actions that your visitor takes so as to avoid the need to load new web pages to respond. You can even have the JavaScript load new images, objects, or scripts into the web page without needing to reload the entire page. <br>
            There is even a way for JavaScript to pass requests back to the server and handle responses from the server without the need for loading new pages.

          <br><br><br>  Incorporating JavaScript into a web page allows you to improve your visitor's experience of the web page by converting it from a static page into one that can interact with them. One important thing to remember though is that not everyone visiting your page will have JavaScript and so your page will still need to work for those who don't have JavaScript. You use JavaScript to make your page work better for those who have it.

            External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
This example uses a full URL to link to a style sheet:

<br>"link rel="styhttps://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css">
